To update the camera firmware on the PR2, do the following:

1. Get a recent ros tree.
2. Build wge100_camera
3. Make sure that no wge100 drivers are running on either machine (this is
VERY IMPORTANT)
4. roscd wge100_camera/firmware_images/
5. ./update_robot.sh

This will take a couple of minutes to run, and will update all the robot's
cameras. If the forearm cameras are not connected, you will get
corresponding errors that you can feel free to ignore.
